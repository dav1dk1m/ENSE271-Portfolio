## ENSE271 LAB 4: Hi-Fi Prototypes with Adobe XD

Your assignment is to choose a real-world location and create a virtual tour in Adobe XD. Your tour should include:

- A home page
- Some type of menu
- Three exhibits, with a page for each
  - Each exhibit should have a name, a set of images and text description
  - The images should be stored in some type of interactive container
    - You can use ones from the prelab, or create your own
- Use a different type of interaction for each page

Please include some images from the exhibits. Many museums license their images in the creative commons, but even if not, it is okay to use them in this project as it is for educational / non-commercial purposes.

For my assignment, I chose MoMA (The Museum of Modern Art) and they provided few virtual exhibitions including Cezanne Drawing, Broken Nature and Engineer, Agitator, Constructor. I included some of pictures from that exhibits and implemented on the Hi-Fi Prototype. I used some of feautures from lab4 excercise including Automatic carousel, image carousel with arrows and progress buttons and lightboxes for the images of Broken Nature.
