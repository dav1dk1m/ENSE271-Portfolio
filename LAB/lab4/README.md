## ENSE271 LAB 4: Hi-Fi Prototypes with Adobe XD

https://adamtilson.github.io/labs/ense-271/lab-4/#assignment
Your assignment is to choose a real-world location and create a virtual tour in Adobe XD. Your tour should include:

A home page
Some type of menu
Three exhibits, with a page for each
Each exhibit should have a name, a set of images and text description
The images should be stored in some type of interactive container
You can use ones from the prelab, or create your own
Use a different type of interaction for each page
Please include some images from the exhibits. Many museums license their images in the creative commons, but even if not, it is okay to use them in this project as it is for educational / non-commercial purposes.
