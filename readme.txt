ENSE271 Lab 1: Github Portfolios and User Story Mapping

For my User Story Mapping (USM) of Planning my semester, I have tried variety of extra features.
- I added personas onto my epics in the backbone. I included professors, lab instructors and my group team members.
- I changed colours of the backbone and walking skeleton to colour of Teal and Green.
- I also added anootations on cards for example I added 'idea' on Make To-Do List since it was my idea to support doing my assignments.
